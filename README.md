# README #

### Requirements ###

* The tutorial will be using python 2.7. Alternatively, Kivy mostly works with Python 3. Mostly.
* You will need Jupyter Notebook and Kivy, as well as the notebooks and example data contained in this repo.
* Easiest way to install Jupyter Notebook is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* NOTE that there is a bug in the current release of Kivy that might crash the install. Luckily the bug has already been fixed in the development (master) branch. I would recommend:
  * install Anaconda
  * create a conda environment (conda create --name myenv)
  * activate the environment ("source activate myenv" on macOS/Linux, Windows is a bit different)
  * install the development branch of Kivy (pip install http://github.com/kivy/kivy/archive/master.zip)
* (Optional) We will show how to build Kivy apps for iOS. To do this yourself requires a Mac and the [kivy-ios](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-ios) package.
